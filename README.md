Exchange History of £ to € from mid-2008 until 2018

# SOURCE:

# MOTIVATION:
For several years I have transferred € to the UK, mostly on the 21st of the month, as this was the day I would receive my salary. 
Over the years I had the impression that it would have been more beneficial, if I would transfer at the beginning of the month, as the exchange rates seemed more preferable. 
With this dataset I wanted to evaluate, whether this impression was correct and if so, how much difference it would make
